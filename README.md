# jQuery Coding Example

## Using jQuery to Fetch and Display Data
This project is intended to demonstrate some jQuery chops.  :)

### Description
This code posts to an API (*https://work-samples.swishersolutions.com/api/api.php*) to receive a list of images, and then displays them in a responsive Angular grid.
- There are two image sets that can be toggled, one of the author and one of superheroes.
- You can order the Images in your preferred order from Most Favorite to Least Favorite by dragging and dropping the images.
- Once you are happy with the order, you can submit your choices with the "Cast Vote" button.
- The grid layout can be zoomed in and out. 
- Each card has a ***View*** button to open the image in a new window.

### Try it out
If you want to download this code and get it up and running in your own environment, you'll need to look for the URLs that are hard-coded. Look for "https://work-samples.swishersolutions.com" in the code, and replace it with your own sources, if you desire. Or you could just leave them and it'll all work out!

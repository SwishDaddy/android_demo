# Android (React Native) Coding Example

## Using jQuery to Fetch and Display Data
This project is intended to demonstrate some React Native chops.  :)

### Description
This code posts to an API (*https://work-samples.swishersolutions.com/api/api.php*) to receive a list of images, and then displays them in a draggable list.
- There are two image sets that can be toggled, one of the author and one of superheroes.
- You can order the Images in your preferred order from Most Favorite to Least Favorite by dragging and dropping the images.
- Once you are happy with the order, you can submit your choices with the "Cast Vote" button.
- Each card has a ***View*** button to open the image in a new window.
